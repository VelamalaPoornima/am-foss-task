**Weather App**
creating weather app is very interesting.
I really love doing this task but it nearly took 3 to 4 days for the api key to get activated.
I watched many tutorials on html,css,js.
As i already mentioned, writing a html css code is like a trial and error method because i have to change the position, background color.
