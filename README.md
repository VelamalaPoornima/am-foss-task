## My introduction
Hello everyone..!!
I am poornima from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, currently studying in first year CSE.
I am not from CSE background, doing these tasks helped a lot to explore more about programming.

## Why you should choose me 
I have always been fascinated by programming.. that is why i choose this branch.. I know regular coursework will teach basics but a club will force me to learn things beyond regular courses.. Also will get different perspectives from club members on best ways to write software. Overall, I think being here will teach me for to be an effective software engineer. 

Hopefully, in future years I can offer the same to juniors who join this club and guide them on how to become effective software engineers.

## What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them
I plan to get good at one specific programming language even though I haven't decided which one. I was told getting good at programming in any language easily translates to other languages. I want to solve problems in coding challenges or interview challenges to act as a forcing function for learning programming. 

In the process I also want to get better at using tools like Git, IDEs like Visual Studio etc.  

Just continuously writing some code over the coming months will automatically help me gain these skills, I think.


## How will you contribute back to the club?
I can empathize with future juniors. There is so much to learn and it is difficult to know where to start. 

Clubs like this and other seniors have given me some pointers which I find really helpful in making progress. I plan to play a similar role for my juiniors where I will provide the right guidance and the right amount of guidance towards making them great software engineers.
