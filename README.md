## My introduction
Hello everyone..!!
I am poornima from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, currently studying in first year CSE.
I am not from CSE background, doing these tasks helped a lot to explore more about programming.

I have always been fascinated by programming.. that is why i choose this branch.. I know regular coursework will teach basics but a club will force me to learn things beyond regular courses.. Also will get different perspectives from club members on best ways to write software. Overall, I think being here will teach me for to be an effective software engineer. 

Hopefully, in future years I can offer the same to juniors who join this club and guide them on how to become effective software engineers.
I will contribute back to the club by participating actively in all competitions and will try my level best.
